# Cars-Market
Cars Market is a project that was built by me personally from 0 to hosting. HTML, Bootstrap, PHP, PostgreSQL, Ajax, JQuery were used for this project. The project consists of two types of users, admin and regular user and the goal is for each logged in user to be able to advertise a vehicle for sale. Each ad must be reviewed and approved by the admin. There is an opportunity to exchange messages, sort, search in detail, publish ads â€¦
